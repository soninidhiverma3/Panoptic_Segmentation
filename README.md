# Panoptic_Segmentation
Panoptic segmentation is a computer vision technique that combines elements from both semantic segmentation and instance segmentation (identifying and distinguishing separate objects of the same class). 
Code Structure

    train.py: Script for training the model.
    evaluate.py: Script for evaluating the trained model.
    infer.py: Script for running inference on new images.
    model/: Contains the panoptic segmentation model definitions.
    data/: Contains scripts to handle the loading and preprocessing of the dataset.

Results

Corresponding segmentation outputs to demonstrate the model's capabilities. Quantitative metricS' results IoU=83.6 or PQscores=61.37.
